Hello, I am Zaid Alrefai. I am a sophmore at Del Norte Highschool. I like cooking, skating, playing videogames, and hanging out with my friends. I am very academically oriented and wish to go to college. I took APCSP because I thought it was interesting and it would be cool to know how to code. My favorite dessert is cookies and my favorite videogame of all time is Elden Ring.
